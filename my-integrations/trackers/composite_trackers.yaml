#require_movement (Optional): true or false. If true, will skip update from a GPS-based tracker if it has not moved. Specifically, if circle defined by new GPS coordinates and accuracy overlaps circle defined by previous GPS coordinates and accuracy then update will be ignored.
#driving_speed (Optional): Defines a driving speed threshold (in MPH or KPH, depending on general unit system setting.) If set, and current speed is at or above this value, and tracker is not in a zone, then the state of the tracker will be set to driving.
